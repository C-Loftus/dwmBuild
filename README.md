This is my build of the linux window manager dwm, dmenu, and the terminal st. All of these 
are from the suckless software utilities and are tailored 
to my own personal usage on an Arch Linux minimal install. 

The original source code without my modifications 
can be found here : https://git.suckless.org/dwm/
